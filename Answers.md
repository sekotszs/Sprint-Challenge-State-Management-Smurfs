1. What problem does the context API help solve?
Context API allows us to share specific forms of data across all levels of the application. It helps solve the problem of prop drilling.

1. In your own words, describe `actions`, `reducers` and the `store` and their role in Redux. What does each piece do? Why is the store known as a 'single source of truth' in a redux application?
Actions are used when an event is used and help define functions, reducers trigger those actions and tell them what to do and state holds and moves data that is being passed in.

1. What is the difference between Application state and Component state? When would be a good time to use one over the other?
App state has the scope of the whole app while Component state has the scope of that one component. Depends on the size of the application whether you use which one.

1. Describe `redux-thunk`, what does it allow us to do? How does it change our `action-creators`?
Redux-thunk allows us to have many different types of actions and it it changes our action-creators by passing new data into them.

1. What is your favorite state management system you've learned and this sprint? Please explain why!
I really enjoyed context API. I thought it was really easy and simple to use/understand!
